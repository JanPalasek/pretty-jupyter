Code Folding
================

Code Folding is a functionality that allows us to show or hide input of the code cells. This allows us to reduce the visual clutter on the output page.

By pressing Hide (Show resp.) the code disappears (appears resp.). We can also hide or show all codes thanks to the option in the right upper corner.

Code Folding can be set up by specifying the following attributes in the metadata (see :ref:`Metadata:Notebook-level Metadata` page). The available settings are:

* ``code_folding: show``: Code Folding is enabled and all cells are shown at the beginning.
* ``code_folding: hide``: Code Folding is enabled and all cells are hidden at the beginning. **This is a default behavior.**
* ``code_folding: disable``: Code Folding is disabled.

The settings can be also overriden on the cell-level with ``input_fold`` attribute (see :ref:`Metadata:Cell-level Metadata`). The available settings are:

* ``input_fold: hide``: The source code of the cell is hidden at the beginning.
* ``input_fold: show``: The source code of the cell is shown at the beginning.
