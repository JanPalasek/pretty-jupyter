Command-Line Interface
==========================

This page describes the basics of using Pretty Jupyter from command-line.

The basic use of Pretty Jupyter is by invoking the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
    :caption: Basic command

    jupyter nbconvert --to html --template pj /path/to/ipynb/file

This exports the notebook file into the html located in the same directory.

Check out :doc:`cli_settings` for more information about its settings.
