Table of Contents
======================

Pretty Jupyter automatically generates Table of Contents for the page. The table of contents looks as below:

.. _toc-figure:
.. figure:: _static/toc.png
    :scale: 50 %
    :alt: Table of Contents output.

    Figure: Table of Contents


Each header from the notebook is automatically added to the Table of Contents.
We can prevent a header from being added to the Table of Contents by adding class ``toc-ignore``.
We can do it like this in Markdown:

.. code-block:: markdown
    
    ## 
    [//]: # (-.- .toc-ignore)

.. note::
    In the code-block above, there is a space after the last #. If we didn't add it, the name wouldn't be empty.
    Instead, its name would be "#".

To turn off Table of Contents functionality completely, we need to add the following property to the notebook-level metadata: ``toc: false``.
